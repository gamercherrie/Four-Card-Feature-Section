## My process
      I decided to transition to React instead of HTML after learning a bit more about CSS. It took me a few days putting
      the components together without any outside help and figured out how to properly use props.
### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- React

### What I learned

This is my first time using React in exchange to HTML alone to make the components. I learned how to easily import and exports
assets and components as it made my code a lot more organized.

### Continued development

I am still continually learning about flexbox and grids for CSS.
